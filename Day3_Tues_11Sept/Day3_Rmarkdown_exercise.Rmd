## R Markdown

Here is an equation using latex syntax
$$ \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\Omega} f(\pmb{x}) dx $$

here is an inline equation $\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\Omega} f(\pmb{x}) dx$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
